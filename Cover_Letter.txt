Dear Hiring Manager: 

I believe I have a good mix of skills for the position of .Net Developer. For the past several years, Iâ€™ve had progressive work experience with .Net web development using .Net MVC, C#, Web API, SQL, Javascript, etc. In my last job, I helped develop an enterprise web application using Web API and Knockout.js. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,
Reginald Capagcuan
