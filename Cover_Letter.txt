Dear Hiring Manager: 

I believe I have a good mix of skills for the position of ASP.NET Developer. For the past several years, Iâ€™ve worked with .Net web development using .Net Web API, C#, MVC, T-SQL, Javascript, Knockout, etc. In my last job, I helped develop and support web applications for an international sports company using Web API and Knockout.js. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,
Reginald Capagcuan
